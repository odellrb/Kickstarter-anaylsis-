## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project was to help Louise understand trends based on launch dates and funding from Kickstarter campaiangs, to help 
her launch her play "Fever".

## Analysis and Challenges
We had to isolate down to the most successful dates and determine which monitary goals where more realistic 
than others. Trying to determine proper launch date and the right goal amount were the challenges.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  May and June are the best times to launch. April and especially October were not good
  times to launch.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  A goal of 5,000 dollars or less had the best results for success.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  The limitations of this dataset do noy paint the whole picture to be succussful. We should look into 
  other variables to get a better idea of how to possibly crowdfund more money and backers.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  We could use Pie charts, bar graphs, and possible a whisker chart if one is interested enough for it.
